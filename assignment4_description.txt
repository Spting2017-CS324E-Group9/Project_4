The overall goal of the project was to animate a beach scene to include waves, clouds, fish, and crabs.

Chris created the animated_crab class, which calls on the crab, crab_claw, crab_leg, and crab_eye classes. The overall shape of each crab is formed using a bunch of grouped PShapes, and the animation is done using lerps.

Then we have the fish class, which Dennis created. Originally we intended to have the fish move its tail as it jumped over the ocean but instead Dennis had a class function called “finMove” which translated the main fin back and forth. The fish class also has a “move” function which when called in the draw loop makes a fish object rotate in a circle behind the wave objects.
