Jacob created the Blobby class, and the clouds and waves are methods of that class.
The Blobbies are a group of 10 primitives, one central core and 9 nine humps that
are randomized for each blobby and are some percentage of the core in size. 
The blobbies move in a few different ways. The blobbies take in the x position and
using a method called y_pos return a yposition of the cloud using a lagrange 
polynomial. The lagrange polynomial uses an arc value which describes the vertex of the 
blobbies parabolic path. The 9 humps also rotate around the core at rate known as rot of the blobby while the core
remains staionary relative to its x position. The cloud and wave methods of blobbies have different paths, rotation 
speeds and colors.
