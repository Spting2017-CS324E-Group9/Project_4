The overall goal of the project was to animate a beach scene to include waves, clouds, fish, and crabs.

Jacob created the Blobby class, and the clouds and waves are methods of that class.
The Blobbies are a group of 10 primitives, one central core and 9 nine humps that
are randomized for each blobby and are some percentage of the core in size. 
The blobbies move in a few different ways. The blobbies take in the x position and
using a method called y_pos return a yposition of the cloud using a lagrange 
polynomial. The lagrange polynomial uses an arc value which describes the vertex of the 
blobbies parabolic path. The 9 humps also rotate around the core at rate known as rot of the blobby while the core
remains staionary relative to its x position. The cloud and wave methods of blobbies have different paths, rotation 
speeds and colors.

Chris created the animated_crab class, which calls on the crab, crab_claw, crab_leg, and crab_eye classes. The overall shape of each crab is formed using a bunch of grouped PShapes, and the animation is done using lerps.

Then we have the fish class, which Dennis created. Originally we intended to have the fish move its tail as it jumped over the ocean but instead Dennis had a class function called “finMove” which translated the main fin back and forth. The fish class also has a “move” function which when called in the draw loop makes a fish object rotate in a circle behind the wave objects.
